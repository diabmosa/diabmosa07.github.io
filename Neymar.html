    <i><h1>"Neymar"</h1></i>
    
    
    <p>
Neymar came into prominence at Santos, where he made his
professional debut aged 17. He helped the club win two
successive Campeonato Paulista championships, a Copa do
Brasil, and the 2011 Copa Libertadores; the latter being
Santos' first since 1963. Neymar was twice named the South
American Footballer of the Year, in 2011 and 2012, and soon
relocated to Europe to join Barcelona. As part of Barcelona's
attacking trio with Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez, he won the
continental treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey, and the UEFA
Champions League, and finished third for the FIFA Ballon d'Or 
in 2015 for his performances. He then attained a domestic 
double in the 2015–16 season. Motivated to be a talisman at 
club level, Neymar transferred to PSG in 2017 and was handed 
the number 10 jersey.[9] The move cost €222 million, making 
him the most expensive player ever.[note 1] In France, he won 
four league titles, among other honours, and was voted Ligue 
1 Player of the Year in his debut season.[12] Notably, he 
helped PSG attain a domestic quadruple in the 2019–20 season, 
and led the club to its first ever Champions League Final.
