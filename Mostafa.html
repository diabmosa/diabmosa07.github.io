<i><h1>"Mostafa Mosharafa"</h1></i>
 <p>He was the youngest student in his class,
 but the most knowledgeable. He obtained his
 primary certificate in 1910 ranking second nationwide.
At the age of 16, he obtained his Baccalaureate in
 1914 to become the youngest student at that time to
 be awarded such a certificate, also ranking second.
 He preferred to enroll in the Teachers' College
 rather than the faculties of Medicine or
 Engineering due to his deep interest in mathematics.

He graduated in 1917. Due to his excellence in mathematics,
 the Egyptian Ministry of Education sent him to England where
  he obtained BSc (Honors) from the University of Nottingham,
   1920. The Egyptian University consented to grant Mosharafa
    another scholarship to complete his doctoral thesis.
     During his stay in London, many of his scientific
 researches were published in prominent science magazines.
  He obtained a PhD in 1923 from King's College London in the
shortest possible time permissible according to the
regulations there. In 1924 Mosharafa was awarded the
 degree of Doctor of Science, the first Egyptian and
 11th scientist in the entire world to obtain such a degree.
